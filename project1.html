        <h> Project for Login Authentication</h>
        <p> In this project, i was design a website’s login authentication bar – where users enter their email ID/username and password to log in to the site.<br>
             Since almost every website now comes with a login authentication feature, learning this skill will come in handy in your future web projects and applications.</p>
